# Think Harder

Engage in intensive analytical thinking to think harder about: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Purpose
This command applies systematic reasoning methodology to complex problems, helping you break down challenges and arrive at well-reasoned solutions through deep analysis.

## Variables
ARGUMENTS: The problem, question, or topic to analyze deeply

## Deep Analysis Protocol

Apply systematic reasoning with the following methodology:

### 1. Problem Clarification
- Define the core question and identify implicit assumptions
- Establish scope, constraints, and success criteria
- Surface potential ambiguities and multiple interpretations

### 2. Multi-Dimensional Analysis
- **Structural decomposition**: Break into fundamental components and dependencies
- **Stakeholder perspectives**: Consider viewpoints of all affected parties
- **Temporal analysis**: Examine short-term vs. long-term implications
- **Causal reasoning**: Map cause-effect relationships and feedback loops
- **Contextual factors**: Assess environmental, cultural, and situational influences

### 3. Critical Evaluation
- Challenge your initial assumptions and identify cognitive biases
- Generate and evaluate alternative hypotheses or solutions
- Conduct pre-mortem analysis: What could go wrong and why?
- Consider opportunity costs and trade-offs for each approach
- Assess confidence levels and sources of uncertainty

### 4. Synthesis and Integration
- Connect insights across different domains and disciplines
- Identify emergent properties from component interactions
- Reconcile apparent contradictions or paradoxes
- Develop meta-insights about the problem-solving process itself

## Workflow

### Analysis Process
- Read relevant files in the codebase if the problem is code-related
- Apply the Deep Analysis Protocol systematically
- Document findings and reasoning at each step
- Synthesize insights into actionable recommendations

### Output Structure
Present your analysis in this format:
1. **Problem Reframing**: How you understand the core issue
2. **Key Insights**: Most important discoveries from your analysis
3. **Reasoning Chain**: Step-by-step logical progression
4. **Alternatives Considered**: Different approaches evaluated
5. **Uncertainties**: What you don't know and why it matters
6. **Actionable Recommendations**: Specific, implementable next steps

## Instructions
- Be thorough yet concise
- Show your reasoning process, not just conclusions
- Question assumptions and consider multiple perspectives
- Focus on practical, implementable solutions
- Acknowledge limitations and uncertainties

## Examples

### Example Usage
```
/think:harder "Should we refactor this legacy codebase or rewrite it?"
```

### Expected Analysis Structure
1. **Problem Reframing**: "This is fundamentally a question of technical debt management vs. development velocity"
2. **Key Insights**: Major factors affecting the decision
3. **Reasoning Chain**: Cost-benefit analysis process
4. **Alternatives Considered**: Refactor, rewrite, hybrid approach
5. **Uncertainties**: Team capacity, timeline constraints
6. **Actionable Recommendations**: Specific next steps with timelines
