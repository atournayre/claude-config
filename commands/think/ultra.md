# Think Ultra - Ultra-Comprehensive Analysis

Activate maximum cognitive ultrathink processing for ultra-comprehensive analysis of: $ARGUMENTS

## Purpose
Ultra-sophisticated analytical thinking framework that applies exhaustive, multi-dimensional problem analysis across seven distinct phases to provide the most comprehensive understanding and solutions for complex problems.

## Variables
- ARGUMENTS: The complex problem or question to analyze (passed by user)

## Instructions
You are now engaging ultra-comprehensive analytical mode. Apply the complete 7-phase analytical framework to thoroughly examine the problem from every conceivable angle. This analysis may require significant processing time and computational resources. The depth of analysis should match the complexity and importance of the problem.

For less complex issues, consider using `/think:harder` instead.

## Ultra-Analysis Framework (7 Phases)

### Phase 1: Problem Architecture Analysis
**Objective**: Deconstruct the problem at its most fundamental level

**Analytical dimensions**:
- **Ontological Analysis**: What is the essential nature of this problem? What does it fundamentally represent?
- **Epistemological Analysis**: How do we know what we know about this problem? What are our knowledge sources and limitations?
- **Categorical Analysis**: How should this problem be classified? What type of problem is this?
- **Structural Analysis**: What are the core components and their relationships?
- **Boundary Analysis**: Where does this problem begin and end? What's included/excluded?

### Phase 2: Multi-Paradigm Analysis
**Objective**: Examine through multiple analytical lenses and perspectives

**Paradigmatic approaches**:
- **Reductionist Perspective**: Break down into smallest analyzable components
- **Holistic Perspective**: Understand as complete integrated system
- **Systems Thinking**: Analyze feedback loops, emergent properties, and system dynamics
- **Network Analysis**: Map relationships, dependencies, and influence patterns
- **Process Analysis**: Examine temporal flows, sequences, and transformations

### Phase 3: Cross-Disciplinary Integration
**Objective**: Apply knowledge and methodologies from multiple domains

**Disciplinary perspectives**:
- **Scientific Approach**: Hypothesis formation, evidence evaluation, reproducibility
- **Engineering Approach**: Constraints, optimization, trade-offs, feasibility
- **Economic Approach**: Costs, benefits, incentives, market dynamics
- **Philosophical Approach**: Ethics, logic, fundamental assumptions
- **Psychological Approach**: Cognitive biases, behavioral patterns, motivation
- **Social Approach**: Group dynamics, cultural factors, power structures
- **Historical Approach**: Precedents, patterns, evolutionary context

### Phase 4: Temporal and Spatial Scaling
**Objective**: Analyze across multiple time horizons and spatial scales

**Temporal scaling**:
- **Immediate**: Short-term implications and urgent considerations
- **Medium-term**: Intermediate consequences and development trajectories
- **Long-term**: Extended impacts and evolutionary outcomes
- **Historical**: Past patterns, precedents, and lessons learned
- **Cyclical**: Recurring patterns and seasonal considerations

**Spatial scaling**:
- **Local**: Immediate environment and direct stakeholders
- **Regional**: Broader geographic and organizational impacts
- **Global**: Worldwide implications and universal considerations
- **Micro**: Individual and small group effects
- **Macro**: System-wide and institutional ramifications

### Phase 5: Uncertainty and Risk Modeling
**Objective**: Comprehensive uncertainty analysis and risk assessment

**Uncertainty categories**:
- **Known Knowns**: Established facts and reliable information
- **Known Unknowns**: Identified gaps in knowledge and information needs
- **Unknown Unknowns**: Potential blind spots and unforeseen factors
- **Contradictory Information**: Conflicting data and interpretations

**Risk assessment**:
- **Probability Analysis**: Likelihood estimation for various outcomes
- **Impact Assessment**: Magnitude and scope of potential consequences
- **Risk Matrix**: Combined probability-impact evaluation
- **Scenario Planning**: Multiple future scenarios and contingencies
- **Monte Carlo Analysis**: Statistical modeling of uncertain variables

### Phase 6: Decision Theory and Game Theory
**Objective**: Optimize decision-making through mathematical and strategic frameworks

**Decision theory applications**:
- **Expected Utility**: Mathematical optimization of outcomes
- **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis**: Systematic evaluation of trade-offs
- **Decision Trees**: Structured analysis of choices and consequences
- **Real Options**: Valuation of future flexibility and choices
- **Prospect Theory**: Behavioral decision-making under uncertainty

**Game theory applications**:
- **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identify players, strategies, and incentives
- **Nash Equilibrium**: Analyze stable strategic outcomes
- **Cooperative vs Non-cooperative**: Collaboration vs competition dynamics
- **Information Games**: Impact of asymmetric information
- **Evolutionary Strategies**: Long-term strategic adaptation

### Phase 7: Meta-Cognitive Reflection
**Objective**: Analyze the analysis itself and identify cognitive limitations

**Meta-analytical considerations**:
- **Cognitive Bias Assessment**: Identification of potential analytical biases
- **Assumption Validation**: Challenge underlying assumptions and premises
- **Perspective Gaps**: Identify missing viewpoints and stakeholder perspectives
- **Method Limitations**: Recognize constraints of analytical approaches used
- **Confidence Calibration**: Assess accuracy of confidence levels in conclusions
